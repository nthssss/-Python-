## demo


```python
new_str = json.loads(json_str)
print new_str
with open('zhiyu.txt', 'r') as fp:
    print json.load(fp)
```


```
[{u'username': u'\u77e5\u9c7c', u'age': 24}, [2, 3], 1]
[{u'username': u'\u77e5\u9c7c', u'age': 24}, [2, 3], 1]
```


## parameters
1. `encoding=None, `指定编码格式。
- `parse_float=None,`
    - 如果指定，将把每一个JSON字符串按照float解码调用，相当于`float(num_str)`。

## loads


```python
def loads(s, 
    encoding=None, 
    cls=None, 
    object_hook=None, 
    parse_float=None, 
    parse_int=None, 
    parse_constant=None, 
    object_pairs_hook=None, 
    **kw):
    """Deserialize ``s`` (a ``str`` or ``unicode`` instance containing a JSON
    document) to a Python object.

    If ``s`` is a ``str`` instance and is encoded with an ASCII based encoding
    other than utf-8 (e.g. latin-1) then an appropriate ``encoding`` name
    must be specified. Encodings that are not ASCII based (such as UCS-2)
    are not allowed and should be decoded to ``unicode`` first.

    ``object_hook`` is an optional function that will be called with the
    result of any object literal decode (a ``dict``). The return value of
    ``object_hook`` will be used instead of the ``dict``. This feature
    can be used to implement custom decoders (e.g. JSON-RPC class hinting).

    ``object_pairs_hook`` is an optional function that will be called with the
    result of any object literal decoded with an ordered list of pairs.  The
    return value of ``object_pairs_hook`` will be used instead of the ``dict``.
    This feature can be used to implement custom decoders that rely on the
    order that the key and value pairs are decoded (for example,
    collections.OrderedDict will remember the order of insertion). If
    ``object_hook`` is also defined, the ``object_pairs_hook`` takes priority.

    ``parse_float``, if specified, will be called with the string
    of every JSON float to be decoded. By default this is equivalent to
    float(num_str). This can be used to use another datatype or parser
    for JSON floats (e.g. decimal.Decimal).

    ``parse_int``, if specified, will be called with the string
    of every JSON int to be decoded. By default this is equivalent to
    int(num_str). This can be used to use another datatype or parser
    for JSON integers (e.g. float).

    ``parse_constant``, if specified, will be called with one of the
    following strings: -Infinity, Infinity, NaN.
    This can be used to raise an exception if invalid JSON numbers
    are encountered.

    To use a custom ``JSONDecoder`` subclass, specify it with the ``cls``
    kwarg; otherwise ``JSONDecoder`` is used.
